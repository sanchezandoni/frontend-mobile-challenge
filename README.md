# SeQura Mobile Frontend Challenge

This is the coding challenge for people who applied to a mobile frontend developer position at seQura. It's been designed to be a simplified version of the same problems we deal with.

## Context

SeQura provides e-commerce shops with a flexible payment method that allows shoppers to split their purchases in differents installments depending on the product price. In exchange, seQura earns a fee for each purchase.

This challenge is about implementing a simplified version of our mobile shopper app.

## Problem statement

SeQura provides the shopper users an aplication where they can see the products they have bought and the instalments they have to pay. The app also allows the shopper to see the details of the product order.

As part of our the product iteration process, the Product Designer from the team has made a wireframe and now is asking you to implement an application to display one screen with order list and another with the order details. The Product Designer is also very interested in analysing any shopper interaction with the app so the team can improve it in future iterations.

We expect you to:

1. Create the prototype for the wireframe that the Product Designer has given you a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/O3OAwL9U95aJVhra4XOooH/Challende-FrontEnd).
   - Integrate the prototype with seQura mock API to fetch orders.
   - Prepare the prototye for an eventual integration for analytics service.
2. Create the animation between the order list and the order detail screen.
3. Create the pay button in the order detail screen that will call the seQura mock API to pay the order.

## Instructions

Please read carefully the challenge and if you have any doubt or need extra info please don't hesitate to ask us before starting.

- [Download the challenge](https://github.com/sequra/frontend-mobile-challenge) code and assets.
- In order to use seQura Mocked API you need to start the server found in the folder `api`: 
  1. Go to the folder `api` and run `npm install`.
  2. Run `npm start` to start the server.
- Create a **README** explaining:
  1. How to **set up and and run** your solution.
  2. An explanation of your technical choices, tradeoffs, assumptions you took, etc.
  3. If you left things aside due to time constraints, explain why and how you would resolve or improve them.
- You should **consider this code ready for production** as it was a PR to be reviewed by a colleague. Also, commit as if it were a real-world feature.
- **Design, test, develop and document the code.** It should be a performant, clean, and well-structured solution.
- You **shouldn't spend more than 5h** on the challenge.
- Since it's frontend challenge, we expect the code based in JavaScript and React Native Library.
- Your **experience level will be taken into consideration** when evaluating.

When completed, send a zip with your README and code, including the `.git` folder to see the commit log, to your hiring contact.
